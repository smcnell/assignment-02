			<div class= "content-info">
				<p> Mark Boulton Design was a small design studio.  In 2014, <font color=#9aced3>we were acquired by Monotype.</font color></p>
				<p> Over the years,we <font color=#9aced3>built an amazing team </font color> and worked on some <font color=#9aced3>tremendous projects with the smartest clients.</font color>  That's something we're proud of, and thankful for.  But, it's time for a change.  </p>
        <p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the problems we want to fix.  Mark Boulton Design is now closed.  The team will be working on Monotype projects from the same premises in the UK and we'll still be writing, still blogging, and still speaking at web conferences.  We're not going anywhere.</p>
